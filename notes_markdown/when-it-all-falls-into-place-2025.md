### New Horizons

As we step into the new year, I find myself brimming with energy and excitement for what lies ahead. Last year was not the easiest; it was marked by stagnation and challenges, but it ultimately brought some clarity. I realized that many of the things I told myself I wanted—and convinced myself I was working toward—were nothing more than excuses. They became distractions, allowing me to avoid confronting the reality of what it would take to achieve what I truly wanted. I think this stemmed from a mix of lifestyle creep, complacency, and the crushing pressure of trying to do too much at once. I juggled countless ideas and let procrastination thrive under the comforting illusion of “I’ll get to it soon.” 

Next year, I want to leave those patterns behind, focus on what really matters to me, and actually follow through on the things I’ve been putting off for too long. And I think 2025 is the perfect year to do it. Unlike 2020, when a lingering sense of unease hung in the air just before everything changed, this year feels *different*—bright, hopeful, and full of promise. It feels like the year where all the hard work, growth, and lessons from the past few years will finally come to fruition—not just for me, but for many of us.  

With that in mind, there are some bits I want to achieve this year:  
- **Launch Knosh 🍊**: My upcoming app is all about transforming how we connect over food. A way to make social dining with friends less faffy. More details are coming soon, so stay tuned!  
- **Take my career to the next level 🚀**: It's is time to explore some new opportunities and see what is out there.
- **Explore content creation 🎬**: Writing, sharing ideas, and creating—it’s time to step out of my comfort zone.  
- **Travel more ✈️**: After years of feeling a bit stuck, it’s time to step away and experiences even more of what the world has to offer.  

A potentially massive opportunity is on the horizon for me. I can’t say much yet, but I hope it works out—it could be a real game-changer. Keep your fingers crossed for me and [stay in the loop](https://bsky.app/profile/daryl.wtf)!

All in all, 2025 feels like the year of *realization*, and I can’t wait to see what’s ahead.

Until then... ✌🏽
