NextContent is my shot at an API-driven CMS. This project comes in 2 parts; the Web UI which acts as the interface for the API (to allow me to test and see the API in action), and the API - where all the CMS logic sits. The API aims to provide the ability to create and manage a CMS backend service. If all goes well, this can then be used as a base for other CMS I may need in future projects.
