## New Horizons

As we step into the new year, I find myself brimming with energy and excitement for what lies ahead. Unlike 2019, where I had a nagging sense of unease just before the world shifted, this year feels *different*—bright, hopeful, and full of promise. It feels like the year where all the hard work, growth, and lessons from the past few years will finally come to fruition—not just for me, but for many of us.  

Here are some of my goals for the year:  
- **Launch Knosh**: My upcoming app is all about transforming how we connect over food. More details are coming soon, so stay tuned!  
- **Take my career to the next level**: Time to push boundaries and step into bigger challenges.  
- **Get back into mentoring**: Giving back and helping others grow has always been a passion of mine, and I’m excited to rekindle it.  
- **Explore content creation**: Writing, sharing ideas, and creating—it’s time to step out of my comfort zone.  
- **Travel more**: After years of feeling a bit stuck, it’s time to explore new places and experiences.  

I also want to share that a potentially massive opportunity is on the horizon for me. I can’t say much yet, but I hope it works out—it could be a real game-changer.  

2025 feels like the year of *realization*, and I can’t wait to see what’s ahead. Wishing you all an amazing year filled with positive change and opportunities.  

Here’s to new beginnings, and as always, keep an eye out for **Knosh**—big things are coming!

Until then... ✌🏽
