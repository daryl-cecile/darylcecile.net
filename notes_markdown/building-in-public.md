For a couple of weeks (months?) now, I have been playing around with the idea of a small API-first headless <Abbr title="Content Management System" link="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/content-management-system/">CMS</Abbr>. I started forming building blocks and planning they way it would look and behave. 

Initially it started off with curiousity around the logic behind what a headless CMS is; I was already familiar with coupled CMS' thanks to my previous work on <Abbr title="SlantedPress" link="https://slantedpress.com">SlantedPress</Abbr> &mdash; so this time, I was keen on working out what a headless approach would be (if I were to build one from the ground up). So I started [architecting, designing, and moulding an API](https://jumbled-dichondra-7a3.notion.site/NextCMS-ce699824a5cb439f822853e0c82dad46).

When I first started thinking about this project, I knew I wanted the process to be product-driven, and from that I had planned to make the entire product React-hook-driven. When designing the initial design around some basic use-cases, I figured I wanted to try and make a powerful API and then have a bunch of React-hooks that could consume the endpoints and be super-easy-to-use‚Ñ¢

Recently however, Vercel and the Next.js team released <Abbr link="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13">Next.js 13</Abbr>; along with it came the introduction to the `app` directory. Find out more about it on their blog. As part of this release, they also introduced Server Components to the Next.js ecosystem - which cannot make use of hooks.

Im excited about this release, but at the same time feeling a little knocked-back as all of the ideas I had would now need to be reformed if I was to make use of the latest Next.js 13 had to offer. 

My hopes for this project is to get a better understanding of patterns and the logic behind headless CMS', push myself to become better at marketing my skills (_we both know I suck at this!_), and maybe make some connections along the way üòâ

Im looking forward to seeing what I can come up with and intend to fully work through this in public - so watch out for updates both on here, and the bird app!

Until then... ‚úåüèΩ
