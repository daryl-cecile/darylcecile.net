**Note:** Ive been pretty ill this week. Lucky it's not the 'rona. So as I'm writing while recovering its likely this post may take a couple of days. Hopefully throughout that time, not much changes with the doc, so I can gather some screenshots and whatnot. For the sake of structure, I wont change the date on this post, so it may appear to be a couple of days older than when it actually goes live.

Last week [Rizwana](https://twitter.com/rizbizkits) discovered a cute little [Co-working space](https://www.cobdenplace.co.uk/) in Nottingham. We had been on the lookout for a place where we could carry out some PF-related work, as well as potentially run some of our upcoming courses. At the time, I was making some upgrades to [PF Campus](https://projectfunction.io/how-we-teach), trying to enable deployments for students to be able to deploy their work to a portfolio as part of their submission process. With previous versions of Campus being on a dedicated server, we offered learners with the option to privately deploy (onto our infrastructure) or publicly via Netlify; however, now that it has moved onto a serverless model, it was time to revisit the options.

As the great advocate that she is, she asked if there was a reason we weren't deploying on Vercel. After all, Campus v2 was already deployed on there, so it only made sense.

Early on in 2021, I had the exact same thought. However, after doing a deep dive, I realised that there was no available packages at the time that interfaced well with Vercel to allow us to programmatically manage projects and deployments the way we needed. And upon further venturing, I came to accept that (a) the available REST APIs was in too much of an early stage, and (b) developing a wrapper around it would be more work than I was able to put in given my day-to-day schedules, and the state of Vercel Documentation back then. In fact the latter was the exact reason that initially pushed me to use Netlify to deploy.

Now before anyone jumps onto the "but Daryl, they provide a CLI" - I know! But it was not convenient and using it programmatically in our setup felt like a hack (we weren't using a command-line interface). So it was best to avoid it. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

After a nudge to give the APIs a second consideration, I thought '*Well surely the REST APIs would have matured a little by now*', and it did ...kind of. While the APIs looked a lot more stable with [different versions](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#introduction/api-basics/versioning) to avoid breaking changes, it still felt a little overwhelming; it felt like a lot of work had to be done on my part to figure out how things work and what the processes were. Some pages had incomplete documentation, while others had incorrect data-types listed for parameters.

### Potential Solution? ü•ä

Despite the issues with the doc, I decided to delve into it a bit more. If I could figure out the missing details and expected data for the API endpoints, I could create a wrapper around the API. This became the plan:
  - Set up a project for the wrapper
  - Consolidate the must-have features (based on PF use-case)
  - Work my way through the endpoints and create wrapper functions
  - Write a script that calls each wrapper function, setting up projects and deployments, checking the status, and tearing them down.

I set up a [small project](https://github.com/daryl-cecile/next-deploy) locally, and once I had all the dependencies in place to package my Typescript project, the journey through the docs began. Going into it, I only hoped the docs would be enough to fill the gaps; however, after looking through the endpoint documentation, I immediately fell in love with the addition of the `interaface` and `type` definitions (written in TS) for responses! It made the guesswork a little easier; and seeing as I was already using Typescript, it was a case of copy-pasta üçù.

![Sample response interface for the Aliases Endpoint](/images/vercel-docs-response-interface.png)

Seeing the typescript interface and type definitions brought about a sense of excitement but that feeling was quickly followed by a sense of defeat once I remembered how incomplete the documentation was as a whole. 

The first gripe was to do with the [Create new deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#endpoints/deployments/create-a-new-deployment) endpoint. It allows you to create deployments using a git source or by attaching files as part of the request. The latter made more sense for our use-case, so I tried to find out what the format and properties should be. Unfortunately, there was no information on this - the little bit of info I found suggested that the `files` property accepted "a list of objects with the files to be deployed". What was this file object? I set up a quick function which made the call to the API endpoint, and attempted to pass the files as a simple key-value object:

```typescript jsx
function CreateDeployment({bearer, forceNew, ...body}:CreateDeploymentParams){
    return axios.request<CreateDeploymentResponse>({
        method: "post",
        url: composeUrl(DEPLOYMENTS_ENDPOINT_V13, {forceNew: !!forceNew ? 1 : 0}),
        headers: {
            "Authorization": `BEARER ${bearer}`,
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
        data: {
            name: body.projectId,
            files: body.files,
            target: body.target
        },
        validateStatus: () => true // prevent rejection on failed request
    });
}

CreateDeployment({
  target: "staging",
  projectId: "prj_Ze66UvH4X9...t",
  bearer: process.ENV.VERCEL_TOKEN,
  forceNew: true,
  files: [
    {name: "index.html", data: "<h1>Test</h1>"}
  ]
}).then(res => {
	console.log('Result:', res)
})
```

After giving this a quick run, I received an error `bad_request` with the following message: `Invalid request: 'files[0]' should NOT have additional property 'name'.` This was interesting ü§î Even though the documentation didnt seem to point out what was needed, the endpoint was doing some type of check to see what properties are expected. Based on the response, it seems `data` is likely expected, but surely there must be a property to specify the file name. After giving 'fileName', and 'filePath' a try (both returning similar errors), I became frustrated and decided to rethink; even if I did manage to guess the name, there is no way data would work without additional formatting - how would I upload image content as a reasonably-lengthened string? 

This realization drove me back to GitHub. Maybe (hopefully?) someone had the same question and found a solution? I searched through all repos including Vercel, but GitHub search really lived up to its bad reputation when it came to code-searching. Luckily they had another tool I could use (currently in beta). Enter [GitHub CodeSearch](https://cs.github.com). 

I began searching globally on CodeSearch for the Vercel deployment endpoint and in no time, I came across [TeleportHQ's repo](https://cs.github.com/teleporthq/teleport-code-generators) which defined an [interface](https://cs.github.com/teleporthq/teleport-code-generators/blob/9f86b0edd484ae9cf6e93849d7f7d3924ce3daa0/packages/teleport-publisher-vercel/src/types.ts#L10) named `VercelFile`. I was a little annoyed I didn't try `file` as a property, but so relieved that there was a drop-in definition I could use.

After dropping in the definition and updating the above code, I gave it another run, and alas the deployment succeeded!

### WIP NOTES

- incorrect expected types
- acknowledge some of these might have cropped up in changelogs but as far as the docs went as a go-to for usage-knowledge it was a dead end
- why i did all of this -> Campus -> Learners deploy
  - Details of the journey for this
  - Outcome so far
  - Point out repo where this is again
