<strong>Edit:</strong> This post was scheduled to be published on the 8th of April, but due to the COVID pandemic and the uni-related consequences it brought about, I had to delay the post. However, I can now confirm that I am now working on another project idea that I have a genuine interest in and enjoy working on.
</InfoBox>

As some of you may know, I am currently in the process of completing my final year project (FYP). Up until recently, I have been doing a dementia based project for my FYP. This included a web portal for carers to manage patients, as well as an Android app which the patients would have on their phone. The app was to help assist with daily tasks such as reminders to take medication, assist in making calls to carer and family members, as well as provide daily mental stimulation games.

The completed app itself would be designed with little-to-no learning curve, so that patients with stage 1 to 3 of dementia and those with memory deficiency would be able to use it with no problem. This would have relied heavily on the principal of repetition and inforcement.

The web platform would be accessible by the carer (who could potentially be assigned to multiple patients) and would allow them to remotely update medication reminders, update contact information, change the mental stimulation games and track behavioural changed based on time taken to carry out each task over time.

Initially, I had so much excitement and ideas for this project, but over time I became more and more demotivated and lost all excitement and will to work on it. This got to the point where it made development depressing and I hated it ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

So I got in touch with my Tutor and Module leader and requested a change of topic. The initial response was "Normally; we'd say its too late, but due to circumstances we could look into the possibility. Do you have a rough idea of how long it will take?". Once I calculated the time and sent a response I felt pretty sure this would be it... I'm still waiting.

I've decided to take the risk and start working on the new project (called *rejig* - thanks to my friend [@rizbizkits](https://twitter.com/rizbizkits) for the name idea) despite the fact I am yet to hear back from the module leader. What i've discovered is that i'm much happier doing this work than I was when I was doing work on the previous topic.

"*I kindly await your response...*"
